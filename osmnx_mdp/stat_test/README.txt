This is a simple statistics exercise.

Null hypothesis: Means of both simulations (see two attached pickles) do not differ significantly.

Running stat_test.py, the result is:
t_statistic = 0.271431065181978
p_val = 0.7861598988198993

Given:
First simulation with n = 10 samples.
Second simulation with m = 10 samples.
alpha = .0975

With this, t value is 2.1009 since n + m - 2 = 18.

Clearly, t_statistic = 0.27 < 2.1009. Thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected.
P value is also really good.

Thus, the two means do not differ greatly.
